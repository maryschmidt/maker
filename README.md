Maker
============================

# What exactly is this?

This is a place for people who make cool things to share what they do, how they do it, and learn from other fantastic human beings.

# Why are you making this?

Because I can.

I'm using this project as a breakable toy, and I've learned a ton about Rails in making it.  I'm always adding functionality to the site, but feel free to borrow any pieces you'd like.

Happy coding!
